# Hi my name is Richard 👋

Passionate web developer with a strong background in front-end development. I have a passion for building web applications that are user-friendly and easy to use. I am currently working as a freelancer and I am looking for a position where I can help you build a better product. I am currently working on cloning [spotify](https://github.com/ricahardHaggioGwati/Spotify-clone). I would love to hear any feedback or advice you might have on any of my projects 😉. I am also open to any opportunities to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
