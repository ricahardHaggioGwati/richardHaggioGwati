## Hi I am Richard 👋

Passionate web developer with a strong background in front-end development. I have a passion for building web applications that are user-friendly and easy to use. I am currently working as a freelancer and I am looking for a position where I can help you build a better product. I am currently working on cloning [spotify](https://github.com/ricahardHaggioGwati/Spotify-clone). I would love to hear any feedback or advice you might have on any of my projects 😉. I am also open to any opportunities to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

- 🍀 I am a fan of the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework.
        - 🍀 I am cureently building all my projects with React.
        - 🍀 I really love the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.
        - 🍀 I am a fan of the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) framework.

- #️⃣ I love working with [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).
        - #️⃣ I mostly write plain CSS because I am not the best at it and I would love to learn more about it and improve my skills before picking up any other frameworks.
                - #️⃣ Check out the [Css Podcast](https://thecsspodcast.libsyn.com/), which is great for refreashing your CSS skills in small manageable chunks.

- 💮 I will soon invest my time into [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), after I feel comfortable with my React skills.
        - 💮 I would also be willing to check if [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is a good fit for me.

I would love to work with whoever is willing to give me the opportunity to work with them.

Happy coding! 🤗
